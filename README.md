# U-Net for Image Segmentation

This is a Pytorch based implementation of U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation which was originally given in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf).  Although originally given for biomedical image segmentation, this architecture has been employed for various image segmentation tasks.

## Datasets
I have used the Caravana Image masking challenge dataset from kaggle for this task.
